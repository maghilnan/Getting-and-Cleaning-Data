## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains code written to satisfy the requirements for the peer graded assignment for the course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/)

### Content of the repository:

- The file `FinalADS.txt` contains the analytical dataset required to arrive at the *"Mean summarized Tidy Data"*
- The file `Mean Summarised Tidy Data.txt` contains the mean value of all the required variables at a Subject, Activity level.
- The `codebook.md` contains the detailed variables description

### Running *'run_analysis.r'*:

- The script is self sufficient, it downloads the dataset set and performs the required action
- Make sure the current working directory doesn't have directory named *"UCI HAR Dataset"* and any file named *"UCI HAR Dataset.zip"*
